 ProxyBI - proxy software to read files on remote unix hosts
           (reachable only in SSH) as they were local files
           available in HTTP on localhost.

 In this way you can "connect" your Excel worksheet or PowerBI 
 document to a remote CSV file (for example) simply using the
 HTTP protocol, with a URL like this :


 http://127.0.0.1:18080/ssh::host::username::password/getFile/_filepath_

 or like this 

 http://127.0.0.1:18080/ssh::host::username::path-to-your-private-key/getFile/_filepath_


 This enables PowerBI to access SARBI files (for example) on any remote
 hosts without having to copy them locally or share them in any way


 DEPENDENCIES : please note that this project has depends from SSH.NET library. 
 You could download it from CodePlex at : https://sshnet.codeplex.com/
 Unfortunately I couldn't include this component 'cause i'm releasing my
 ProxyBI tool under a different license.
